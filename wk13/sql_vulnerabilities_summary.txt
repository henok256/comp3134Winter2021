I have created the database on the digital ocean named users.
I have create the form in file named getusers_1.php. 
The form has 2 things first is a input field and another is 
submit button so it will  get the information from the database with 
get method. so it will be easy to get it. 

I have entered the 3 input which are

Ben
Ben’--
Ben’ or 1=1
