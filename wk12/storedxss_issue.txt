In the text file i have written everything as i was told by 
professor and i did everything. After that i created the php file 
which reads the text file and print on the browser. i wrote the follwing
code 

<?php
$myfile = fopen("storedxss.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
echo fread($myfile,filesize("stored.txt"));
fclose($myfile);
?>

but when i executed it did not work i got no result. It means the code 
could not read from the file.
