I noticed that there is a bit difference in both files first 
csfr_action.php and the second one is csfr_form.php

This is copied from csfr.php and csfr.html files respectively.

There was a little change in both files. in the first one which is 
csfr_action.php i had to get a session variable named confirmation
and i created the variable named confirmation. Moreover, i had to 
retrieve the value named confirmation and i ensure the session variable
and confirmation value are equal.

However in second file, csfr_form.php i created the variable called 
confirmation and assigned some random value to it. and i sent the
 session variable value as a hidden form  field value named 
confirmation.  
the code is below.

<input type="hidden" name="login_email" id="login_email" 
value="<?php echo $_SESSION['email'];?>" />
