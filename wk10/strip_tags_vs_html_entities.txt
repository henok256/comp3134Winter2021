There is a little deference between script tags and the html 
entities. Html entities are converting some of the texts into 
specific kind of logoes or code. for example If you use the less 
than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might 
mix them with tags. so for that differece we write the entities code

we have some of examples

<	less than				&lt;	&#60;
>	greater than				&gt;	&#62;
&	ampersand				&amp;	&#38;
"	double quotation mark			&quot;	&#34;
'	single quotation mark (apostrophe)	&apos;	&#39;
