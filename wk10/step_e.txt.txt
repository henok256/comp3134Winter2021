For the first question i can use the basename() function as prof
gave a hint that will check whether there is a html directory 
or not. if its not there it will generate the error.

The second question to look if the folders that do not exists by
using file_exists() function and that goes through all the folder 
check if it's available it will go into but if its not it will
generate an error.

The bonus question was quite deficult for me because i am not good 
in php language.I tried to do but could not do it.
